---

## **3. Problem Statement**  
Many people want to learn new things but can't afford paid classes. Others are ready to teach what they know. There is no simple app to help people exchange skills for free.

---

## **4. Proposed Solution / Idea**  
**SkillSwap** is a mobile app where users can teach a skill and learn something in return. Example: someone teaches guitar and learns coding. This version will only show the frontend using mock data (no backend yet).

---

## **5. Key Features**
- Login and Signup (UI only)  
- User profile with skills offered and needed  
- Skill listing with search/filter  
- Booking simulation with date/time  
- Chat screen with fake messages  
- Ratings and reviews (UI only)  
- Notification icon with dummy alerts  

---

## **6. Target Users / Audience**
- Students  
- Freelancers  
- Hobby learners  
- Anyone who wants to share and learn skills  

---

## **7. Technology Stack**
- **Frontend:** React Native (Expo)  
- **Navigation:** React Navigation  
- **State:** useState / Context API  
- **Storage:** AsyncStorage (optional)  
- **UI Components:** React Native Paper (optional)

---

## **8. Expected Outcome**  
A working mobile UI where users can:  
- View and search skills  
- Simulate booking and chatting  
- Rate and review other users  
All data will be handled locally, without a backend.

---

## **9. Timeline**
- **Week 1–2:** Setup project and navigation  
- **Week 3:** Skill listing and search  
- **Week 4:** Booking screen  
- **Week 5:** Profile and chat screens  
- **Week 6–7:** Ratings, notifications, and testing  
- **Week 8–9:** Final UI improvements and documentation

---

## **10. Additional Notes**
- Frontend only (mock data)  
- No real login, chat, or backend yet  
- Easy to upgrade later with Firebase or other backend  

---

## **11. Future Scope**
- Real user login and database  
- Real-time chat and notifications  
- Skill matching with AI  
- Video calling and nearby users
